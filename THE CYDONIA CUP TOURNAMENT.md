# THE CYDONIA CUP TOURNAMENT 

# Rules and Conditions:

## SPORTSMANSHIP:
The Cydonia Cup is about friendly fun primarily. However, given its competitive nature, each combatant will be required to adhere to these rules.


- Play fair. Absolutely no forms of client side assistance permitted. This includes wireframing, hitboxes, combat features or nimble
- Trust, but verify. All combatants will be required to stream their client via Discord during their matches to our judges.
- Respect the game. No "throwing" or attempting to rig a match. Each combatant is expected to give their 100% and not yield to their opponents.
- Respect the outcome of a match. Defeated combatants must humble their losses. A single "rematch" will be permitted if the victor proposes it. Even if the outcome is different no further rematches are permitted. 
- Respect the players. Taunting and disruptive behavior will not be permitted during matches. Quiet cheerleading is permitted.


## GAMEPLAY AND GENERAL RULES:

- All registered combatants will be given a "Cydonia Tournament Rifle". This is a semi-automatic rifle with 20 rounds in the magazine. This is the only weapon permitted during the tournament. All registered combatants will be given the rifle 1 week before the tournament (when the registration deadline has been met) to allow them to practice and become comfortable with the weapon. The weapon will be sent out at the same time to ensure all combatants have roughly the same time to acclimate to it.
- No HUDs, AOs, or movement enhancers will be permitted during the Tournament.
- Accidental primshots will void the kill/round. Intentional primshots will be given a warning and void the round. Subsequent primshots will disqualify a combatant.
- There will be 4 separate tournaments. Everyone is permitted to register in up to all 4 or as few as 1 granted they meet the requirements.
